# TOP Javascript Course Project - Weather Site
03/17/2022 ~ 03/23/2022

## Objectives
Using a weather API, create a simple weather site.

Allow users to do the following:

- Switch between celsius and fahrenheit 
- Allow users to search for a location and get the weather for that location

## Learnings
Working with APIs can be really fun but really have to think about all the error states that could be thrown if something goes down on the API side. While building this project, there was a short problem with the weather API where it was truncating the 7-day forecasts into 6-days. It was resolved after a few hours but it was good practice in planning out error states.
